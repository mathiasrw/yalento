# Yalento  
An awesome framework that combines the best benefits from [AlaSQL](http://alasql.org) and [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) written in typescript for best using in Angular and Node.js projects:

- Write normal SQL-Queries and get observable **realtime** result changes.
- Supports **near by** queries and provides geo informations.
- Native integration of most common features like pagination or selection.
- Local storage connector
- **Made for serverless** (google cloud functions, aws lambda, etc).
- CRUD operations for any, even complex, javascript objects
- Full **offline support** und high performance guaranteed.
- User and role based **security framework** (global, collection and entities)

## Example for node.js / angular

### Repository of anything
The yalento repository supports even complex javascript objects where you can do search, orderBy and many other operations. However in practice you work with simple model classes like the following one:

    export class Contact {  
      public name: string = '';  
      public lastName: string = '';
      public street: string = '';
      public age: number = 0;
    }

Your model must not extend from any yalento classes - just write your classes how you like it. Only if you work with objects in a repository, then you need the yalento class and IEntity type:

    import { Repository, IEntity } from 'yalento';
    const repository: Repository<Contact> = new Repository(Contact, 'Contact');
   
Now we are ready. Let's create two new contacts from repository:

    const contact1: IEntity<Contact> = await repository.create({ name: 'Bob', age: 10});
    const contact2: IEntity<Contact> = await repository.create({ name: 'Jan', age: 28});

And what about querying? Nothing easier than this.

    const kids: Array<IEntity<Contact>> = repository.select({ where: 'age < 18'}).getResults();

Instead of ‘getResults()’ you also can use ‘getResultsAsObservable’ if you want to observe changes in the repository. That means, your subscribers get informed whenever data has been changed (new contacts matching your query, contacts data changed, etc.). 

#### readonly results
If you just wont to read data or if you are using yalento as state storage, then you should access to selection only via 'getReadOnlyResultsAsObservable()' method. This method returns an `array of Contact` (array of original model).

### NearBy / Geo informations
Yalento is including a state of the art library, that allows you to query data by theirs location. The following example stands for great simplicity.


    private long$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject<number>(40.1);
    private lat$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject<number>(5);
    private radius$: BehaviorSubject<number> = new BehaviorSubject<number>(100);

	connectFirestore(firestore, { nearBy: { long: this.long$, lat: this.lat$, radius: this.radius$} });

Once you have connected firestore with nearBy option, then every selection call returns only data that match long, lat and radius values:

*Example: With nearBy option only kids are returned when they are in given radius:*

     const kids: Array<IEntity<Contact>> = repository.select().getResults();
 
With activated nearBy option each result contains geo information data automatically:

     const kid: <IEntity<Contact>> = repository.select().getResults()[0];
          
     // read distance betwen current long$ and lat$ values and the kids geo location
     kid.getDistance(): number 

You can set the kids geo location by calling:

    kid.setGeoPoint(latitude: number, longitude: number).save();
    
And what about order the results by distance? Nothing easier than this.

    const kids: Array<IEntity<Contact>> = repository.select({ orderBy: '__distance ASC'}).getResults();
    
### CRUD

Once you have selected your data (read), maybe you go to work on it.

*Example: Create new contact with default values from current selection. Contact3 will have age of 17 automatically, because its part of the kids selection! (create)*

    const contact3: IEntity<Contact> = await kids.create({ name: 'Mia'});
    
*Example: Two way binding for an angular component (auto-update)*

    <input [ngModel]="contact.name" (ngModelChange)="contact.setProperty('lastName', $event).save()">
    
*Example: Update one or multiple contacts (update on demand)*

     html:
        <input [(ngModel)]="contact1.name">
        <input [(ngModel)]="contact2.name">
        <input [(ngModel)]="contact3.name">
        
     ts:
        contact3.save();  ||  await repository.update(contact3);
	    await repository.updateMultiple([contact1, contact2]);

*Example: Delete one or multiple contacts (delete)*

    contact3.remove();  ||  await repository.remove(contact3);
    await repository.removeMultiple(contact3);

*Example: Delete all selected contacts. For paginator see corresponding examples bellow (delete)*

    await repository.removeMultiple(kids.getPaginator().getSelected());


### Observable realtime changes
The observables are really useful if you connect your repository to "Google Cloud Firestore" or to any other database with realtime updates support:

    const firestore = firebase.initializeApp({  
	    apiKey: '***',
	    ...
    }).firestore();
    
    repository.connectFirestore(firestore);
    
Now, you have successfully connected your repository to realtime database of cloud firestore. This has the consequence that:

 - repository.select({ where: 'age >= 18'}) automatically fetches matching contacts from remote database
 - repository.create({ name: 'Bob', age: 10}) puts new contact to remote database
 
 Don't forget to unsubscribe from all observers to avoid memory leaks:
 
 *Example to unsubscribe from all subscribers after leaving an angular component.*

    ngOnDestroy(): void {
          this.contactRepository.destroy();
    }


### Paginator

Using the native pagination makes most sense, if you are in the context of an angular app. The paginator prevents fluttering effects when updating frequently, e.g. of list views because it deliberately transmits individual changes to the views. Let's see how easy yalento works with the google material component:

    <mat-paginator [length]="kids.getPaginator().getLength()"  
	    [pageSize]="kids.getPaginator().getPageSize()"
	    [pageSizeOptions]="kids.getPaginator().getPageSizeOptions()"  
	    (page)="kids.getPaginator().setPage($event)"
        [pageIndex]="kids.getPaginator().getPageIndex()">
	</mat-paginator>

Nothing to configure - you've already implemented all the pagination component features. Unless you also want to implement one of the many requirements: select, select all, invert selection.

    # toogle all (all kids get selected)
    kids.getPaginator().toggleSelection();

    # toogle one (first kid get selected in this case)
    kids.getPaginator().toggleSelection(kids.getResults()[0]);

    # get all selected kids
    const yourKids: Contact[] = kids.getPaginator().getSelected();

### Nesting objects

You can create subobjects for each object and thus map a complete tree structure:

    const repository = new Repository<T>(Toy, 'Toy');  
    repository.connectFirestore(firestore, {   
         parent: [{  
            documentId: kid.getUuid()(),  
            modelName: 'Contact'  
         }]  
      });
      const redToy: IEntity<Toy> = await repository.create({ color: 'red'});

 In the example above you assign a red toy for the kids into a child collection. By adding one level you can create a tree something like 'contacts->toys->accessoires:

    {   
         parent: [{  
            documentId: kid.getUuid()(),  
            modelName: 'Contact'  
         },
         {  
            documentId: redToy.getUuid()(),  
            modelName: 'Toy'  
         }]  
      }

### Connector local storage

You can connect every yalento repository with connectors like local storage connector. The local storage must be an implementation of key-value object storage like ionic/storage:

     import {Storage} from '@ionic/storage';
     const storage = new Storage({
                name: 'kids'
     });const repository = new Repository<T>(Kids, 'Kids');  
      
     repository.connectLocalStorage(localStorage);
     

## Example serverless
### google cloud functions

The yalento repository is optimized for running serverless applications. You can easily query, e.g. create cloud functions and return the results as json. You benefit from the fact that the repository retains all data in the memory and monitors changes to the source databases in real time. This leads to extremely high reaction times (<5ms).

Let's look at an example for a serverless function:

    import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';  
    import * as firebase from 'firebase-admin';  
    import {Repository} from "yalento";
    
    const fb = firebase.initializeApp();  
    const repo = new Repository<Contact>(Contact, 'Contact');  
    const select = repo.connectFirestore(fb).select({where: 'age > 0'});  
      
      export const helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
        select.toJson().then((json: string) => {  
            response.send(json);
            }).catch((e) => {  
            response.send(e.message);
            })  
        });
The output of the example is a JSON array of Contacts, if you call the 'helloWorld' HTTPS endpoint.


## Documentation

We are working on it.

### Firebase Cloud Firestore security rules
If you connect the yalento repository with firebase by `repository.connectFirestore(fb);` method, the cloud firestore is automatically structured as (we use the examples from above, where 'Contact' is the name of the model):


| Level | Path | Document |
|------------------------------|--|--|
|Document |{Contact}/data/{contacts}|Contact: { name: 'Bob', age: 10, __owner: { EVERYBODY: true}}|
|Collection |{Contact}/permissions|Permissions {}|

As you can see in the table there are two levels of privileges. Privileges on documents affects only one document where privileges on collection level affect all entities.

#### Collection privileges
The permission document is empty by default. You should add one for each model/entity via firebase admin console. Everybody has full read and write privileges, if the document is empty. Yalento uses the best practices from firebase documentation about [firestore rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started). The permission document  once per model/entity is defined like here:

    Permissions: {
				    get|list|create|update|delete: {
					    AUTHENTICATED|AUTH.USER.UID: boolean 
				    }
                 }
Each key of the permission document that is not defined makes the privilege as public for everybody. So if you do not add 'get' key, then everybody can read data. The following examples explain the mode of operation:

*Example 1: Only authenticated users can read a document or list a collection of given model/entity. All other operations are allowed to everybody.*

    Permissions: {
				    get: {
					    AUTHENTICATED: true 
				    },
				    list: {
					    AUTHENTICATED: true 
				    }
                 }
                 
*Example 2: Only user with uid 'TEST'  can update documents of given model/entity. All other operations are allowed to everybody.*

    Permissions: {
				    update: {
					    TEST: true 
				    }
                 }

#### Document privileges
Your entity contains an additional property '__owner' that is added automatically by yalento. With this property you specify document level privileges:

    Contact: { name: 'Bob', age: 10, __owner: { EVERYBODY: true}}

The __owner property has EVERYBODY as default value. So everybody with collection privileges can execute all read and write operations.

    Contact: { name: 'Bob', age: 10, __owner: { TESTUSER: true}}

Connecting yalento repository with dataMode option  `repository.connectFirestore(fb, { dataMode: 'PRIVATE' });` adds automatically the currents users uid to the __owner property. In private dataMode only users can access documents, if they are owner of it. This mode affects  querying, writing and reading. If you execute a select like `const kids: Contact[] = repository.select({ where: 'age < 18'}).getResults();` you only get kids who have your UID as owner key.

### The firestore.rules
Yalento implements very basic privileges to avoid any performance troubles, but you can extend the default [firestore.rules](https://github.com/miegli/yalento/blob/master/firebase/firestore/rules/firestore.rules) provided by yalento whenever you want to do. Please note, however, the [limits of firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas).
